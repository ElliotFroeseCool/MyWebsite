	Things That are Stupid - July 26, 2024
	</div>
	<div class="blackbarblog">

	<div class="textblog">
	1. $100<br>
	    Why do we put a $ sign before the number but the % sign after. You say "Five percent", not "Percent five", and "Five dollars", not "Dollars five". WTF<br><br>
	2. 12 Hour and 24 Hour Time<br>
	12 Hour time makes no sense. Unless you live very near the equator, and even then it makes only about 1 sense. You could say that AM is when the sun is up, and PM is when the sun is gone, 
	but the time that that happens everyday changes all the time, even at the equator.<br>
	There is no consistant boundry between AM and PM, so why divide the day into 2 parts? Just for fun? There is a historical reason for AM and PM, but just because its the way things have always been done, does not make it any less stupid.<br>
	24 Hour time is a little bit better, but not by much. It probably makes about 3 sense. It does not divide the day into 2 arbitrary parts, which is good, but it still has the biggest flaw that haunts both 12 and 24 hour time. The decimal system.<br>
	60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day. Why? Again there is a historical reason for it, but its still stupid. There is a reason most of the world switch to metric and stopped using imperial measurements, because it makes
	so much more sense to divide things by multiples of 10. It makes everything so much easier. I propose a solution. 100 seconds in a minute, 100 mintues in an hour, and 10 hours in a day. For this to work we would have to make the second 0.864 of what
	it used to be (shorten it by ~1.157x). This system makes wayyyyyy more sense. Probably at least like 43.
